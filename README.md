# CSE 4340 - LAB 1

This is a simple application written for iOS that leverages Bluetooth Low Energy to establish a peer-to-peer communication service. It will enable your iOS device to act as both a peripheral and a central simultaneously in the process. The application, as a peripheral, advertises an arbitrary string that can be read by another instance of the application acting as a central.
